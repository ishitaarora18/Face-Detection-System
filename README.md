# Face-Detection-System

A face detection system using basics of computer vision that analyzes image frames to identify human faces. 

The preprocessing includes converting images to grayscale and then applying techniques such as edge detection and feature extraction.

Haar Cascades is used, which is a machine learning based classifier that detects faces by identifying patterns of light and dark regions corresponding to facial features.
